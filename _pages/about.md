INTRODUCTION:

I am a data-oriented person with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. With a background in cloud computing, data analytics, and generative AI, I specialize in designing efficient data models and crafting scalable solutions. This portfolio showcases several projects I have worked on during my time at Bear Brown Company, where I honed my skills in data-driven development. My current focus is on pushing the boundaries of AI and computational art, continually evolving with the latest technological trends.

EXPERIENCES & INTERESTS:

üëã I‚Äôm a graduate from Northeastern University with an MS in Information Systems, specialized in data and product analytics. Skilled in SQL, Python, and cloud technologies like Snowflake, Azure, and AWS, I excel in developing robust data pipelines and analytics solutions.

üöÄ At Wolfspeed Inc, I enhanced operational efficiencies and data accuracy in IT data, inventory, and procurement using advanced data engineering techniques and tools such as ServiceNow and Excel. At CitiusTech, I managed complex healthcare data, applying my skills to improve data accuracy and compliance with healthcare reporting standards. Throughout my academic projects, I utilized Alteryx and Talend, deepening my expertise in data warehousing and ETL processes. My toolset also includes proficient use of BI tools like Power BI and Tableau.

üìä Throughout my academic projects, I gained extensive experience using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NLP techniques to analyze and visualize data, enhancing project insights. I also honed my UI/UX design skills, creating user-friendly interfaces and improving user interactions for various applications.

üõ†Ô∏è In addition to my technical expertise, I have experience in product management, where I define and execute data strategy roadmaps, aligning business objectives with product development to design innovative solutions. I have worked on building data ingestion pipelines, enhancing data governance frameworks, and translating user needs into meaningful product features and user stories.

üîç With experience in predictive analysis, machine learning, regression, time-series analysis, data architecture, and product management, I consistently deliver accurate insights and innovative solutions. I am eager to leverage my skills in data collection, profiling, transformation, visualization, forecasting, product analytics, and supply chain analysis to drive impactful results in dynamic environments.

PROJECTS:
(Click Github link on the left to know more!)

Diabetes Risk Prediction (Python)

This project's main goal was to thoroughly assess and choose the best machine learning model for predicting diabetes. This project is significant because it has the potential to improve early intervention and preventive strategies for people who are at risk of acquiring diabetes. The urgent global health issue presented by diabetes served as the driving force for the selection of this specific topic and dataset. Accurate and prompt identification of those at risk becomes crucial due to its rising prevalence and significant impact on public health.

Superstore Sales Analysis (SQL)

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL to derive valuable insights. Key metrics include total sales, profit margins, and customer segmentation. The project involves writing complex SQL queries to track product performance, identify top-selling regions, and uncover sales trends over time. By leveraging SQL, the analysis provides a foundation for data-driven decision-making to optimize business strategies.

Web Scraping (Python)

The primary aim of this project is to leverage web scraping techniques to extract valuable data from the Yellow Pages website. This dataset will serve as a starting point for future research projects. It includes a complete list of restaurants in a specific place, including key insights such as restaurant names, contact information, precise addresses, customer ratings, and a variety of other relevant information.

Supply Chain Anaysis Dashboard (Power BI)

The dataset used in this Power BI project is from Kaggle, titled "DataCo Smart Supply Chain for Big Data Analysis." It includes comprehensive information on various aspects of supply chain management such as sales, customer details, product categories, shipping details, and more. This dataset is crucial for analyzing and optimizing supply chain processes, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management, demand planning, sales performance, delivery efficiency, and customer insights.

SaaS (Software as a Service) Support Chatbot (Python- AI models)

This SaaS Support Chatbot is designed to assist users with common questions related to a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. The chatbot handles user queries related to pricing, features, trials, cancellations, and support. The chatbot can be deployed on a company's website or customer support portal to provide quick and efficient support for customers, reducing the workload on human customer support agents.
The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recognize the user's intent and respond appropriately. The initial version uses basic predefined responses, but it can be expanded using dynamic NLP techniques, AI models, or by integrating with real-time SaaS backend systems.
